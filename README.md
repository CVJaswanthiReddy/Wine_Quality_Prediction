# Wine_Quality_Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict the quality of wine based on various physicochemical features using machine learning techniques implemented in Python.

### Files
- **Wine_Quality_Prediction.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the Python code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and prediction.
- **winequality.csv**: Dataset containing the wine quality data.

### Dataset
The dataset (`winequality.csv`) is included in this repository. It contains the following columns:
- Fixed acidity
- Volatile acidity
- Citric acid
- Residual sugar
- Chlorides
- Free sulfur dioxide
- Total sulfur dioxide
- Density
- pH
- Sulphates
- Alcohol
- Quality (target variable)

### Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn

### Contents of `Wine_Quality_Prediction.ipynb`
1. **Data Loading**: Reading the dataset (`winequality.csv`) into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning data, handling missing values, and feature scaling.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing distributions, correlations, and relationships between features.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or transforming existing ones.
5. **Model Building**: Training machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks).
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating models using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
7. **Conclusion**: Summary of findings, insights from the analysis, and potential areas foareas for further improvement.
